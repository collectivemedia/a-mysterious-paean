\noindent The throne of knowledge lies inside his head, \\
Amid those dusty shelves of memory; \\
While Collective hangs upon a fraying thread, \\
His wisdom carries through its history; \\
For knowledge is but cleverness of art, \\
A skill to comfort, ease, simplicity, \\
While analytics 'tis core to Collective's heart, \\
The will to push through others' stupidity, \\
Is a price that comes with high cost; \\
His cheeky wisdom is a certainty, \\ 
We can trust the data will not be lost, \\
So dear is this severe commodity, \\
My wish for his wisdom has a price \\
For I must deal with his snarky vice! \\
